<p>I don't read as often as I did back then but I wanted to at the very least mention some comics that have left a considrable mark in my tiny brain. These can range to traditional published visual novels, to eastern webcomics.</p>

 It's practically impossible to find a wholesome yuri comics that isn't archetypes to fuel a gross male fantansy. Sora and Haena isn't that special in terms of story but I appreiacte the silly endering dynamic the two have. Just like most slice of life eastern webcomics, the story drags for unnecessary reasons. But if you're looking for some mindless silly story, why the hell not. </p>

<p>If it weren't for my horrible Scott Pilgrim brainrot, this would be my favorite work from Bryan. The art and concept goes beautifully hand in hand. Katie is an asshole that is motivate by her own selfish desires, which drives the plot and leaves you wanting to read more in hopes to see how eventual demise will come along. The world literally breaks as she jumps from one timeline to another and was visualized wonderfully. It's a well rounded story that has perfect pacing. Although a couple nitpicks would be (1) She's simping for the ugliest warewolf looking as guy and it's really funny to me. (2) It's lowkey underwhelming how she resolved this entire world ending crisis (3) and it was unfair how despite all of that "you need to accept what you have" she still ended up with what she wanted.</p>

<h1>Scott Pilgrim</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Stupied Rating:</b> 8/10</li>
</ul>
<p>"Scott Pilgrim is an asshole" literally any person who has a brain reading Scott Pilgrim. But funnily enough, these same people are most likely to be the biggest fan of the visual novel. For the unimformed, Scott Pilgrim is a coming of age story of this dimbwit, Scott. Despite his stupidity I actually enjoy Scott as a character. I think he's silly and yes he's flawed but that's the entire point of the story. Scott is someone blinded by his own desire and in turn hurts the people around him. When confronted with this notion, he denies and/or completely forgets about. Leaving the people who supported him with no sense of closure. He remains ignorant of his behaviour up until Ramano appears in his life and he gets treated the same way he treats others. This causes him to think about his pass actions and takes the time to own up to his behavior. I love this so so much. If it weren't for the fact the ending with the "oops you're not actually a bad guy, I was responsible for all your bad actions uwu". grgrrrr  waahhhahhahaha i hat ethis ciomic o much jcdbnu waaaaaaaaaaaah</p>

<h1>How to Love</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">

</ul>
<p>It really sucks that the only way a webtoon can really succeed with milions of readers, is to make it a bl or a cliche love story. It leaves tiny gems like these hidden. This comic was made by the same guy who made the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/webcomic_name/?hl=en" target=blank>webcomicname</a> strip. Just like his main comics, How to Love is a silly comic that tell love advice in abstract fun ways.</p>
