<li><b>Stupied Rating:</b> 7/10</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the first Wright Edgar film I ever watched. I went into it completely blind. I didn't know the stigma behind the movie and the person behind it. I simply saw a small preview of the film through netflix and I thought "why not". It was a nice movie. I remember having to constantly pause the movie because mama kept calling me lol. The visuals and it's overall cinematography is, as every has hyped it up to be, absolutley amazing. As for the plot itself? As someone who's read the comic as well, I can say it was a big meh. There's so many things wrong with the plot. Which then again, considering it's flimsy souce material, I really don't blame it. For further insight go to <a href="comics.html #scottreview">this page</a>. Overall a really cool movie tho.</p>

<p>I HATE HATE HATE HATE THIS MOVIE. snails go brooooommmm. snails go vrooooooooomm. i love the snails lack of originality!!! go girl give us nothing!! snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie. snail movie.<br>
<i>i love snails.</i> why does he look so ugly and stupid?
have you ever seen how ugly snails are lol
would of been so much cooler with a into the spiderverse artstyle with it's beautifully rendered shots and use of lighting. There were genuinely really cool shots and I love how often the movie scales out to remind us how tiny turbo is against everything around him. But that's just life isn't it? We often feel like tiny snails stuck with gigantic mechanical beings rushing through the finish line. Turbo being hit with reality realize how stressful actually being in track is and he trips and stumble and almost gets crushed. He was so closed to giving up. But in a fleeting moment, he remembers that the thing that made it an inconvenience was the very thing that got him there. Instead of comparing himself to other racers he uses his own skill set to advance. To sticking to walls, to getting underneath other racers. Turbo learned to be himself. And with his sheer power and support of the people he loves, he wins the race. generic dreamworks film that enabled my snailsession</p>

<h1>Shaun of the Dead</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Stupied Rating:</b> 10/10</li>
</ul>
<p>After seeing Scott Pilgrim, I got curious and decided to watch the cornetto trilogy movies to see how his style influences other genres of movies. Out of the three, Shaun of the Dead was my absolute favorite. I don't watch zombie films that much because of how boring and generic they usually are. Here's a group of people! The movie refuses to give us a reason to care about them, but we're supposed to care because???? Oh nooo look they're in a bad situation awooo. Don't worry the military is here to save you!!! And that's pretty much a big chunck of zombie movies, which is why I hate this genre of films so much. Watching Shaun and Ed's dynamic was different tho. It was endering and fun. You see what type of person Shaun is. He's not a perfect person, but he's a relatable character that tries his best and you can't help but root for him through out the movie. Paired with fun reccuring jokes and super cool transitions, you go from silly duo zombie movie to an absolute nightmare. They've reached a dead end. There's no where to go and everything is just hopeless. Shaun tried his best but still lost everything. His opportunity for a good father, his mother, and eventually every single person he's ever love was about to die. I was at the edge of my seat genuienly considering and getting upset of the possiblity of everyone dying. And boom!! The ending, though a very cliche one, was a breath of relief. Super cool movie</p>

<h1>Jojo Rabbit</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Stupied Rating:</b> 10/10</li>
</ul>
<p>Jojo Rabbit isn't afraid to use irony to it's extreme. The idea of some kid wanting to become Hitler's best friend is the most revolting yet silliest premise to stumble across. One of my favorite subtle detail in the cinematography is the focus of the mom's shoes. While watching the film I took note on how unique the mom's shoes was and how often the movie placed it into frame. But as the story progresses the realization began to seap in and BOOM it happened. It was an absolutley heartbreaking scene. The people who complain about this movie being too offensive are too clamy to realize how much of an amazing anti-war movie this is. They also completely ignore the main theme of Jojo Rabbit. The kid in the movie is a nazi blinded by his own belief and refuse to see the world in the lenses of the people he's dehumanizing. He justifies his actions not through factual evidence, but because he's an impressionable kid who see's everyone else doing it. But once faced with the very thing he's afraid of, instead of weeding it out, he stops and takes the time to learn about them. He asked the jew questions and learned that they are just like him, people with thoughts and feelings. With this wider preception of reality, he becomes an better person.</p>

<p>There isn't a thing about this movie I can say that some random disney fanatic has sperged all over twitter. It's a super cool movie with an amazing sound track made by the one and only Lin-Manuel Miranda! Despite the restraining time limit movies can have, it is an emotionally drivin story that does a wonderful job creating this mystical yet clearly flawed environment. Super fun stuff</p>

<p>When cartoon network wasn't busy shoving teen titans go down everyone's throats, they showcased gems like these. If it wasn't obvious from the intro itself, it's grossout humor. It's a silly goofy cartoon that showcases the exaggerated stupid things kids do to kill of time. It's genuinly very endering and I could honestly can go about how much I love each and every character. But I've sperged enough lol. Here's <a href="media/videos/clarence2.mp4" target="beep">a fun clip</a> that I think does a wonderful job reflecting the type of humor Clarence had.</p>

So many fond memories of going on to youtube to watch my little pony with my older sister. It's just such a fun show that overdelivered with it's initial premise, and for that I'm forever greatful for all the fun plots that stay rent free in my head. Go tax avoidance!!</p>

</ul>
<p>During very specific dates and in very specific times of the day, I would rush to turn on the tv to watch this show. Whether it be a new episode or another rerun. Back then I couldn't properly pin point why but I really enjoyed this shows. And rightfully so beacuse it clearly is a humourous show filled with a lot of soul into it. It clearly reflected and understood the humor of the time period, and I dare say, suprpased it.</p>
