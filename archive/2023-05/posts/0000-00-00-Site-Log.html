	  <h4>24 May, 2023</h4>
	  <p>Added 3 website buttons :D</p>
	  
     <br>
	  <h4>23 May, 2023</h4>
	  <p>So I downloaded a text editor on my phone and I no longer have to deal with the painful built-in ui for neocities lol. Fixed the banner link. I made the rules page. Still working on the out of context and announcements page though.</p><br>
	  <p>I've decided I want to name the /JAM/ board to /PL4Y/ which stand for "Programming Like a 4-Yr-old". Yes I know the name is a stretch and that most 4 year olds don't know jackshit about coding. But I thought the name looked cool. Speaking of boards. I was thinking of maybe making something called /AAA/ for "Art and Animation"</p>

	  <p>Embeded in cbox! I'm  on mobile rn so I don't want to properly format everything and post rules. Ngl the crappy chinese ui might grow on me lol</p>
	  
	  <br>
	  <h4>21 May, 2023</h4>
	  <p>Made CL better. I unfortunately can't perfectly align the box vertically using flexboxs. Mostly made minor changes like:</p>
	  <ul><li>Making the global font size as 16px because I realize how obnoxiously large 18px looked</li><li>Forgot to write "_blank" for certain anchor tags, so I added them in.</li><li>Adding an indents to lists</li></ul>
	  
	  <br>
	  <h4>20 May, 2023</h4>
	  <p>Believe it or not I still want to work on this website lmao!! Anyways attempted to redo the home page but now it looks like ui for a chinese news app,,, Extremely unhappy with it and will take another jab at it in a later date. I also finally got CL up!! Once it get filled, I'll be making a filtering system. Anyways really tired now gn I love you go lick a cheese</p>

	  <h4>10 Apr, 2023</h4>
	  <p>Aha! I got the responsive navigation to work. I inserted all the boards I think I will have but they're all empty for now. I was really struggling to get it to work since I used flexboxes to center the my list and I could not for the life of me figure out how to make them into columns. The way I fixed it was completely by accident and I was literally just typing random bullshit. Oh well If it works then it works. :'D<br><br> Anyways here are the explanation of the new boards:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>CL - Comics and Literature - I almost was about to call it LC lol. As the name suggests I'll be putting comics and stories here for you to read straight out of my website. What about my storage limit? Oh, don't worry about that. I'll be using an external image hosting site :)</li>
	  <li>JAM - Games and Music. I have a bunch of games I want to make and I will post links of them here for convenience. Idk much about making music but it just there for if ever I find time to pick up piano again</li>
	  <li>Slug - As I've said, it will contain website designs completely detached from here. Since it's an experimental art board, I will most probably not prioritize responsiveness (sorry mobile phone users). I called it slug because it will probably have sluggish loading time</li>
	  </ul><br><br><p> I also learned that you can use variables in CSS and I'm just!?!?!?!? So naturally I went back and changed it. It's very minor but I'm sure it will be heaps of help once I attempt to add in website themes. Speaking of which, I'm not even sure if it's possible? Most examples I've seen of it is for websites that use iframes. I'm pretty sure you can't make cookies with JavaScript. Idk though. I'll cross that road when I get there. I did quite a lot these past 5 days. I think it's time I take a break and actually study for the test tomorrow lol.

	  <h4>09 Apr, 2023</h4>
	  <p>Hello and welcome to the website's log! Here I will record major changes I've made and what I plan to do. This website was made on April 6 of this year!<br><br>I have so many things I plan to do. Currently I got the about page and the blog working (using Zonelets). I plan to modify it to have certain post be seafoam to signify it is a fictional story or maybe just make a new board for it entirely. But before I add more boards, I'd like the responsive navigation finished first. Yesterday I uploaded 3 banners. I plan to add more and maybe have some gifs chucked in with it. <br><br>I also spent a lot of time scrolling through other sites and man is my home page underwhelming. Right now I have a basic website cut out design but I will change it in the future to be more aesthetically appealing. Seeing other people's sites is so cool and I want to make something as cool as theirs! This is why, once I'm satisfied with the main boards, I will be making the /SLUGS/ board. It's going to be stylistically detached from this site and basically a huge dump site for fun experiments.</p>
