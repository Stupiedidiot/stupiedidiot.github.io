	  <p>It’s kinda funny really. I don’t know how and when, but I started to dislike birthdays. What was once a cheerful celebration, is now a bitter reminder of the hours I have wasted.  Time is a harsh wave that will not wait on a speck of sand. <br><br>
	  This unfortunately brings me to now. Here I am staring at my discolored laptop screen, encoding what I mindlessly scribbled on paper. Occasionally a tiny doodle occupies a portion of a page. This doodle is not much different from what I would make half a decade ago. That’s more the reason I hate it. <br><br>
	  To think I’ve been drawing for years yet never made art. Or at the very least, made good art. While staring at the vast ocean, a feeling washed over me. An overwhelming feeling of fear whenever I was forced to move along the current. The gust of sea aggressively yells at me <i>“Are you a better person than you were a year ago?”</i> <br><br>
	  To be honest, I don’t think so. Maybe that’s what’s wrong with me. I mean what am I even supposed to do in such a situation? Stand my ground against nature? Up, down, right, and left, I see that I am not the only grain of sand being dragged about. It is foolish of me to think I should be a special exemption to what is a common situation. <br><br>
	  I think I’d be a little more happier if I learned to go with the flow.</p><br><hr><br>
	  <p>Super ulta-edgy tots serious metaphors aside, I’ve been having a lovely day. Played some scrabble with my brothers. I won them with a 25+ ppm! It’s not the best compared to professionals, but I haven’t played scrabble in months and I had forgotten how fun the game can be. Had some pancit for lunch and I am currently eagerly waiting for my dad to buy ice cream. >:3<br><br>
	  Truth be told I have a test this upcoming Tuesday. I haven’t studied a single subject because of how busy I was making this website! I am very appreciative of the fact you took time of your day to read my nonsense. That is all for today. Goodbye and kindly consume some cheese.
