     <p>I usually write these posts on a piece of paper and encode them back to my computer afterwards. This would mean that not everything I post will be made during the same day I wrote it down. Currently I am sitting in the school canteen, regretting my life choices.

After bullshitting the Filipino mastery test, I decided to go indulge in some popcorn. I'm uncertain what exactly possessed me. I asked for salt instead of cheese powder for my flavoring. This would've been fine if it weren't for the fact the lady placed 3 scoops of salt???? It was so unbearably salty,,, sob,,,
<br><br>
I'm uncertain of the exact size of the measuring spoon but it was about the same diameter of a 20 peso coin (roughly an inch). Speaking of money, I spent 25 pesos on this and I wasn't planning to waste it!!!!
