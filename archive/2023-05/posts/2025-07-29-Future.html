        <p>Henlo, this is Stupied but 2 years older since I started making this version of this website. This basically kick-started my love for front-end web development. At the time I had a weird affinity for anonymous image boards and based my website around that theme - with the randomized banners and weird folder names.</p><br>

        <p>I genuinely can't remember what prompted me to do this. None of the artists I were following at the time were preaching the whole 'quit social media and join the indieweb' stick. I remember Literalhat writing an article about how you should archive all your old work but was that really all it took? Past me's thought process will forever be a mystery...</p><br>

        <p>Either way, It's really fun going through my shit ass spaghetti code. Especially since it's got a weird ass quicks such as:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>Index of folders were inside the root with the same name. Basically I would have <code>pl4y/</code> and a file <code>pl4y.html</code> - had to fix this cuz it bothered me</li>
            <li>I used discord to host all my images so I had to retrieve them</li>
            <li>I didn't organize my files properly. My root folder is so painful to look at.</li>
            <li>Almost all my elements have no margins so I have to use 'br' every time I make need spacing</li>
            <li>I would compress the shit of my stuff for no reason???</li>
            <li>I choose a really ugly font</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>I found this old <a href="./2023-04-15-Turbo-Movie-Review.html">Turbo Review</a> I never finished. I'm not even sure if I can count it as a review. It's more of a really retarded retelling. It's been roughly 3 years and I still won't shut up about this movie haha-</p><br>

        <p>It's quite funny to think I used to work on this website through the neocities editor, with my phone as well! Working on this website became my obsession. I was literally animating my buttons during a class presentation.</p><br>

        <p>Pretty neat to see despite how much I've changed, there's still so much that stays the same.</p>
