<p>Welcome back to my shitty blog. Unless of course this is your first time. If so, Hi!!!! Hello!!! My name is Stupied. You may call me Sandy, if you perfer a less derogatory nickname.</p>
<p>Idk when this random set of characters will make it live on my website but I hope you all know I am super happy with the new layout. It took like 3 tries to even get to what you are seeing on screen rn. I am so happy with it. I placed everything in neat little folders and everything. Are you proud of me?? I’m so cool and smart B))))</p>
<p>What’s the difference between blog, articles, and topics you may ask? </p>
<p>Blogs are a lot more messier and casual and usually just me babbling about random things going on with my life. Articles are for my cohesive put together opinions and discussion of whatever interest me. Topics are mini shrines for specific things.</p>
<p>Idk why but every month I randomly get the urge to start programming something. I would just spend the entire day googling and thinking up dumb project. Luckly most of them rarely see the light of day. I started learning c# in hopes to make games. I understand object oriented programming conceptually but it doesn't make writinig it any less daunting.</p>
<p>Most of what I have in mind aren't all that complicated (I hope). They're mostly basic point and click mysteries.</p>
<p>Okay that is all byyyyyeeeeeee</p>
