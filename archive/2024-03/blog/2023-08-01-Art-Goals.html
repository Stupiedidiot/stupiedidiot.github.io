<p>Ahh yes, the first day of the month. A signifier of the year's progress and reminder for me to get my shit together.</p>
<p>I have bit of a confession. I haven't been drawing as much as I usually do. Which was to say every single day. I would pick up a pen and just aggressively scribble whatever came about. It didn't matter whether or not it made sense or if it looked nice. It was all just pure compulsiveness. A desire to create for the sake of it.</p>
<p>On those rare occasions I would go like "hey, I actually want to make something somewhat decent" and make something somewhat decent I did. I would sketch the same thing over and over till I found the best iteration. Then I would carefully plot out the colors and lighting before fully committing to rendering. It was a painstakingly long process that would take me 2-5 hours. Which is an extremely huge leap from my usual minuet doodles.</p>
<p>The outcome of them? Honestly not that bad. I was impressed! In fact, many of my favorite drawings were from mid-2022. Every time I look at them, I feel nothing but pride knowing that "hey, I did that!"</p>
<p>Sadly, I haven't felt that way about my art for quite some time. Every time I attempt something overly ambitious, I would get upset of nothing working out and leaving untouched for months to come. Whenever I open up Krita to paint I keep thinking of all the ways I could muck things up. The next thing you know, art felt more like a necessity than a desire.</p>
<p>Does this mean I've regressed? No, I haven't. My skills are still the same from a year ago. It's just that I reminisce of the past to fondly.</p>
<p>The problem with pride is that it likes to tag along a friend named dread.</p>
<p>You get this desire to create something better than the last! It has to be! If it isn't then what good is it for? With this type of mindset, you get stuck in the negative feedback loop. You get so scared of making a mistake you'd rather just stand perfectly still instead.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though. After a lot of careful consideration, I came to this very compelling question: “But why tho?”</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty looking art is cool but that was never the reason why I got into it in the first place. Drawing was meant to be an outlet. This gateway from the physical world to my subconscious. It has always been and should continue to be nothing dumb fun.</p>
<p>For this month I want to take it upon myself to draw something every single day again. It doesn't have to be massively impressive They can be small studies and poorly written comics. If I happen to make something somewhat decently, then that’s cool too.</p>
<p>No pressure to be the best it can possibly be, just doodling whatever my 2 tiny braincells tell me to. I’ll be posting everything I’ve drawn in a blog post by the end of the month :D</p>
