<p>I initially played this game a couple few hours before the mastery test. I like to blindly try out free games for shits and giggles. I booted up the game with the assumption that it would be those short boring games with an ungodly amount of text and nothing to say. To my surprise, it was not.</p>
<p>The graphics aren’t the best but it’s charming enough to fit that lost retro game vibe. The mechanics were simple. Gather around ropes, use tools to make better rope or access places, and then bring them all to the well where you’ll get different endings based on the amount of rope collected.</p>
<p>Finding ropes never felt annoying or had pretentious solutions. There was always that “Aha!” moment, and the good kind at that. I was so excited to see all the endings, especially because every ending flashed a single digit of what looks to be a phone number. Who does this number belong to? Where’s Lily’s parents?</p>
<p>When you do find out these things, let me tell you it is absolutely jaw dropping and worth the effort. It took me about 5 hours to go through the entirety of the game on my own. Hidden rooms and all.</p>
<p>Would I recommend this game to others? Hecc yah! The game's free and the story is awesome :)</p>
