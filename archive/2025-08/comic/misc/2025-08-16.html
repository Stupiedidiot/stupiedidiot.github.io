            <p>Conceptually, maintaining human relationships sounds fucking awesome; In practice, not so much. I often find myself quietly listening in to other people's conversations. Yearning for the effortlessness at which they share information and finding genuine endearment despite the pointlessness of it all. I think back of the opportunities I've had for this and how I've squndered wach and every one through monotone indifference. Maybe some people are just meant to be locked up in their room, never to utter a word.</p>
