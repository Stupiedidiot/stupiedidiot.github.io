            <h1>Writing is Hard :(</h1>
            <p>It takes about 30 steps to go from my desk to the corner of our living room and back. 30 steps I take multiple times a day for when I get excited of an idea and need to walk it out. I would tap my fingernails against the concrete door framing, smiling like an idiot, just to walk back to my room like nothing had happened. Once I've calmed down, I stare back at my laptop screen with my hands curled over the keys. Reality settle in and I face a blank white screen.</p>

            <p>I've always had a difficult time concentrating. I get so enamored by my own little world, I waste time in my real world just thinking about it. I want nothing more than to be able finally put down the thoughts and feelings of the little guys in my head. I want others finally to witness their antics and be as equally enchanted by their lives as I have.</p>

            <p>I can make as many playlists as I'd like and doodle my characters a hundred times, but none of it matters unless I write it down. Which is something I greatly struggle to do. Writing requires breaking that world apart and loosely putting them together in ways other's can understand. It requires me to give up on a idolized vision and face the capacity of my skills.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately there is just no way around it. If I want a snowball's chance in hell to materialize my characters life, I just have to get comfortable with writing. I have to feel comfortable with giving up my perfect world.</p>
