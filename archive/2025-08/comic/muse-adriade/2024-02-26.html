            <p>
                Kicking my foot on the wood above me<br>
                Wondering why you bothered staying<br>
                It's not that I don't love you<br>
                I just wish you'd listen<br><br>
                
                My body may be 6ft under<br>
                But my soul lives on through words<br>
                Don't promise me forever<br>
                Just let my voice seize the breeze<br><br>

                What's the point of another day<br>
                If it's spent stuck inside my room<br>
                Waiting on some miracle<br>
                Wrapped in aluminum foil<br><br>

                My body may be 6ft under<br>
                But my soul lives on through you<br>
                Don't promise me forever<br>
                Just continue sailing the sky for me

            <p><b>Prompt:</b> write about echoes, sound, and reverberation. what is an echoâ€“ just sound or something more? how can it reverberate through past, present, and future? can emotion be an echo in that way? what else can be?</p>
