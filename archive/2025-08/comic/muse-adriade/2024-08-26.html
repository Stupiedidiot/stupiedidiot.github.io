            <h1>Laundry Day</h1>
            <p><i>A sad shriveled up plant, that's what you remind me of.</i> Mopsy hated whenever I crash in her apartment to ditch Saturday classes but in my defense I wasn't <i>in</i> her apartment, not for today at least. We were on the rooftop hanging up her clothes. She had so many similar pairs that it was numbing to see the waves of floral skirts distorting to the wind's whims. "Remind me to get you new clothes".</p>
            
            <p>"Remind me of when I asked". I always find it funny when Mopsy snaps back. She looked so uptight and composed, you'd never expect her to be such a spiteful bitch. Getting nauseous of the textile patterns, I shifted my eyes to the corner. It's then when I spotted it; a singular potted plant placed a little too far from the left side. "Remember Ms. Jenkins?" Mopsy asks, probably noticing me staring.</p>
            
            <p>"The old lady from next door?". With the increasing work hours and the war's troubling developments, the country's been a total shit hole. We're all just keeping our heads down, trying to get through. Which is why it's unfortunate when Mopsy responds with "Yeah, she passed away recently. Had her children pick her stuff up". Ms. Jenkins was the kind of person you'd share a good laugh over some biscuits and coco. You'd always walked out her apartment, having a bit more hope for this god forsaken world. I wish this world had more people like her. Or at the very least, didn't take them away so quickly. "That one was already wilting when they got here. They must of thought it was a lost cause"</p>
            
            <p>If you listen closely you could hear the potted plant letting out gentle cries. It was the grey curled up leaves pleading the wind for mercy, many of which had already given in and lay dismembered on the floor. Some leaves we're a little fortunate than other, retaining patches of it's lush green color. Kind of like a small reminder of it's colorful past; a time of when it stood tall and proudly took in the suns rays. It was a stark contrast of what it was now, looking down to shy away under the walls' shadows.</p>
            
            <p>When Mopsy finally picked up the last sweater in the bucket, it was heavy from soaking up all the water from the clothes above. She squeezes the water back in and stuck the sweater between a small space between two other articles of clothing. Mopsy always had this distant look. The kind of expression that let's you know that she isn't living in the present because she was too busy worrying about the future. It's a shame really. I lift up the bucket and watched the liquid dissolve into the dried up soil. <i>I would never give up on you that easily.</i></p>
