            <h1>Selective Seclusion</h1>
            <p>"What are your plans for today?" It was quite a silly question for her mother to ask, considering that she already knew the answer. Feeling too lazy to muster up the voice to respond, Psyche lets the boiling kettle speak in her place. She flips the stove off and watched her makeshift tablea syrup pour unto the stack of pancakes. It wasn't very often she gets to eat like this. Her mother insists on minimize sugar intake because of her father's condition. As much as Psyche loves him, she never understood why she has to eat the same things he did.</p>

            <p>"Maybe we can invite your friends to come over?" With his mouth still stuffed with tuna amapalaya, her father makes a suggestion. It was followed up with a small coughing fit and pounding of the chest. "Yes! That would be wonderful, don't you think? Evan Odd, right? We can ask his sister if-". Her mother's voice trailed off as Psyche and her poor excuse of a breakfast make their way to her bedroom. Psyche took each step down as carefully as possible to ensure not to drop any of the walnuts and chocorocks she scattered around the plate of pancakes.</p>
            
            <p>Her world was contained within the four corners of that basement. Although you wouldn't be able to tell that basement had four corners because the amount of stuff inside. It seemingly stretched into an endless horizon. It was basically a time capsule of unfilled wishes and forgotten times. Like the boxes of clothes that don’t fit her anymore or the generator her father promised to get around fixing. The dusty blue floral curtains of a small window were slightly ajar, allowing the sun to peak at the mess. She pushes aside some paper and spare change to make room on her desk. With a click of a button, a familiar whirring noised could be heard. The birds muffled scratching were overpowered by the computer’s synthetic sound effects. The world outside just keeps going; Unlike in here, where everything it was constant. It’s just how Psyche liked things. Or perhaps she’s done a good job convincing herself of that.</p>

            <h1>Seclusion</h1>
            <p>I knew a girl who’d spend every day in her room, staring at her glorified light box. Every name on the list being her own. Which is no surprise since the company has long since shut down their servers, forcing her to rely on the local leaderboard.</p>
