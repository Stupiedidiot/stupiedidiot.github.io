            <h1>You Suck Ass at Apologies</h1>
            <p>How did I find my self back here? With my arms curled around your neck, comforting you once again for the pain you've inflicted on me. Even after all these years, after the nasty words spat straight to my face, you still expect me to be the one defending you. It was never your fault was it? It was her fault you grew up like that. Or maybe it was mine for not dropping every single thing I have for you. How fickle is your trust, that it is persuaded by whispers you weren't even there to witness? When will you realize that, unlike you, the perception of others isn't limited to auditory clues. That the slamming of the doors and sharp side eyes is louder than that alarm clock you don't even get up to. This didn't occur because of your kindness. This is what happens when I slip up. When I allowed the compassion you've abused to trick me into thinking you might do better. If you really want to do a better apology, you can start by putting in the work to actions; Instead of mindlessly regurgitating the same bullshit. Damn, I could of been watching turbo fast rn.</p>
