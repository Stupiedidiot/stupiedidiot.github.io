<p>Characters I like enough to bother writting about</p>
</section>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://turbo.fandom.com/wiki/Turbo_(character)" target=blank><img src="media/characters/1.jpg"></a>
<div>
<h1>Turbo</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Snail Kin!!</li>
</ul>
<p>I love snail movie i love snail movie i love snail movie. Something I didn't fully dived into my Turbo review was that I love how at the end of the movie his shell breaks and he just sorta gives up. Then his friends and family come along and motivate him to continue despite losing his speed. It really shows that skill can only take you that far. You can literally be the fastest snail in the world but it doesn't matter if you dont have the indurance to finish what you've started. Super fun stuff. It's quite difficult to pin point why, but there's just something about him that makes me go "he's just like me fr". Just a really fun positive character and I love him for that.</p>

<a href="https://scottpilgrim.fandom.com/wiki/Envy_Adams" target=blank><img src="media/characters/2.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Envy Adams</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> One with awesome fits</li>
</ul>
<p>Woooooh!!! GO GIRL!! Not much to say since Scott Pilgrim characters is as hallow as they can get but gosh I love her.</p>

<a href="" target=blank><img src="media/characters/9.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Princes and Knight Cookie</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> i am not projecting shut up</li>
</ul>
<p>I love their silly dynamic. They're just two idiots doing idiotic things. good for them</p>
</div>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Cutie_Mark_Crusaders" target=blank><img src="media/characters/6.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Cutie Mark Cursaders</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Only Bestest Friend Group Ever</li>
</ul>
<p>Their shenanigans fun and endering but I also love the episode where they got their cutie marks. Not only did Diamond Tiara get a charcater redemption arc, but the manner and meaning of the trio's cutiemarks is something wonderful. Each pony has their own talents that has curated from years worth of trying to get their own cutiemarks. It's when they take the time to step aside and help others, is when they truly found the thing that makes them happy.</p>

<div>
<h1>Calisto Yew</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Chatoic Evil Sapphic</li>
</ul>
<p>She kills people and probably kisses women tbh. She's literally one of the few great things the first Miles Investigation game. She's introduced to be calm and collected then she goes into a laughing fit. My favorite charcter intoduction ever. Not to mention her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nNsmuTuIjc" target=blank>theme</a> slaps. I really wished the game really dove into the yatarashu narative so we could of seen more of her</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Justine_Courtney" target=blank><img src="media/characters/7.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Justine Courtney</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Mommy? Sorry.. Mommy??</li>
</ul>
<p>She's a fun and mysterious character. Elegant yet clearly flawed. I can assure you I was so confused during the entirety of the last two cases and her mystery was such a wonderful way to pace us to the already amazing game. Miles Investigations 2 will forever be my second favorite game.</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Sig" target=blank><img src="media/characters/10.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Sig</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> fellow tiny creature appreciator</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually found Puyo pop through an animation of this fella. I like him for the same reason I like my imaginary invisionment of Red from pokemon. He's just a chill guy vibing also I'm a simpilton and find his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgM4JO8Ka_A" target=blank>vc</a> funny.</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Raffina" target=blank><img src="media/characters/11.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Raffina</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Insecure Evil Rival</li>
</ul>
<p>She has a one sided rivalry that is, although presented to be a silly gimmick, I've always personally headcanon as a deeper insight to her psyche. She acts condescending towards Amitie despite being weaker than her. In terms of magic she needs to use her pouch paired with martial arts to even reach the same level as her peers. It's been shown during Lemres' run in the 20th Anniversary that Raffina is extremly insecure about her reliance to the pouch and panics when Lemres points it out. I like to believe her egotism is nothing more but a defense mechanism of the truth she is too scared to come to terms with. Especially since she comes from a prestigious family. Aside from that, I love me a evil pink haired villain!!!</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Lidelle" target=blank><img src="media/characters/12.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Rider/Lidelle</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Precious lil Baby</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite it being outdated, I like to call her Rider simply because it's easier for me to say and remember. I lowkey ship her with Raffina for the reason I've explained above. She's shy and insecure about her apperance. Which is why she tucks her horns and wear baggy clothes. She's always looking up to people much more confident than her, especially ones with horns themselves. I like to headcanon that she (despite getting yeeted outed of fram during Puyo Fever 2) looks up to raffina. Raffina arrogantly accepts all her compliments and the two would spend time together. Raffina won't admit it but she apprieciate Rider's company and overtime began noticing and admiring small things that Rider is ashamed of. The two help one another to learn to accept themselves for who they are and lessen each other's insecurities</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Rarity" target=blank><img src="media/characters/4.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Rarity</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Femme Lesbian</li>
</ul>
<p>Favorite of the mane 6, for obvious reasons.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://scottpilgrim.fandom.com/wiki/Kim_Pine" target=blank><img src="media/characters/3.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Kim Pine</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> The only morally right person</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being presented as a rude assertive person who hates everyone, she ends up being the most caring person in the entire Scott Pilgrim cast. She is empathic person who is aware of everyone around her. She, despite pertending to be annoyed, is extremly patient with the people around her. Whether it be listening to Ramona or dealing with Scotts bullcrap. She honestly deserves so much more.</p>

<section class="aboutrow2">
<a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Trixie" target=blank><img src="media/characters/5.jpg" target=blank></a>
<div>
<h1>Trixie</h1>
<ul class="minibox2">
<li><b>Character type:</b> Loveable Dumbass</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm convinced she has no braincells. Like??? Then again I too would be quite pissed if some pony got me unemployed for doing silly magic tricks. I love her and Starlight Glimmer's friendship so much. Starlight Glimmer is someone who is struglling to forgive herself for what she's done and convinced herself that she doesn't deserve to have friends. Then there's this bluey dumby making explosions for the fun of it. Super fun stuff.</p>
