<h1>Final Thoughts</h1> 
<ul class="minibox2"><li>June 10, 2022 - 2:43pm</li>
</ul>
<p> As of writting this right now, it is the deadline of submissions for each and every subject. I started this project on the <b>‎26th of ‎May ‎2022, ‏‎2:54:09 pm</b> and it's honestly insane how far I've gone through with this. 2 weeks and a half, and I have quite a lot to say.<br>
<br>
I'm not the best at coding but I really had to utilize the basics I was taught. It was a lot of expirementing and googling what I could and couldn't do. Lots of this and a little less of that. And probably a lot of time putting togther pieces of media I wanted to showcase here. I highly doubt that the teacher would read all through those but regardless I wanted each and every page to be personal and won't miss an ounce of my thoughts. It was really fun using all the things I've been taught into creating this little site.
Admittingly there were a lot of content and ideas I had to cut out due to the lack of time and knowledge in javascript. Things that I had to cut include:</p>
<ul class="weee">
<li>1. Interactive Menu</li>
<li>2. Image modal for my gallery</li>
<li>3. A proper music and video player</li>
<li>4. More content in general</li>
</ul>
<p>
If I had more time I think I could of made those possible by leaning the fudamentals of javascript. Despite that, I'm okay with the outcome of everything. I can say at most centainty say that this is somthing I'm proud of.

<h1>Notes from the future</h1>

	Henlo, this is 2025 Stupied writing from the future. This website was made for a major project for school. Pretty sure my laptop was broken at the time and I has to make this through my older brother's PC.
