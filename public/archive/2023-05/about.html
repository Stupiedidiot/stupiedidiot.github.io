	<h1>Hi I'm Stupied!</h1>
	<p>I'm a wannabe artist who thinks they're cooler than what they actually are. I draw, write, program and video edit. As you can guess, I'm a master of none of those.<br><br>
	Welcome to my stupid stupied containment site! This my personal blog and a dumpsite for one-sided discussions of media I like. You can also find my other shenanigans over at:</p><br  id="socials">

	  <h1>>What's in the name?</h1>
	  <p> Pronounced as it's sounds (ˈstü-'pīd ), my pen name dates back to my elementary years. I consider myself quite literate but I lack skills in spelling. I found it funny that no one ever bothered correcting the way I spelled stupid up until grade 6. So I decided to proudly wear this mistake lol.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h1>>Where can I learn about your ocs?</h1>
	  <p>Ha! Very bold of you to assume you can. I have an unhealthy amount of ocs. I've developed a fear of sharing about them, for reason that are too lengthy to explain here. I will make comics about them soon, I promise. xD</p>
	  <br>
	  <h1>>What are your inspirations?</h1>
	  <p>When it comes to my art specifically: <a href="https://literalhat.com/" target="_blank">Literal hat</a>, <a href="https://kittydog.carrd.co/" target="_blank">Kittydoggo</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/radiomaru/?hl=en" target="_blank">Bryan Lee O'Malley</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carles_dalmau/" target="_blank">Carles Dalmau</a> comes to mind. I am inspired by a lot of things and it's difficult to pin point them all! I could go on and on but I think it's best to save those ramblings for another time. </p>
	  <br>
	  <h1>>Do you do commissions?</h1>
	  <p>I've done quite a hefty amount of them, but the paranoia never seems to go away. I tend to stress about whether or not my art is worth the price I give it. Feel free to personally ask me, but know that there is no guarantee.</p>
