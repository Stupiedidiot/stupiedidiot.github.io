    <h1>Whereever I May Be</h1><br>
    <p>
    Do you think phoenix's were shocked<br>
When it first occurred?<br>
Dust as their feathers shucked.<br>
Particles fly out to be unheard.<br><br>

Was it scary<br>
When they rose back?<br>
Did their past make them weary?<br>
Did the wind force them to this callback?<br><br>

Upon heaps of paper,<br>
My mind goes blank.<br>
May I ask a favor?<br>
Please write the words my story lacks.<br><br>

Wherever my dust may flew,<br>
Know that Iâ€™m still in love with you.<br>
