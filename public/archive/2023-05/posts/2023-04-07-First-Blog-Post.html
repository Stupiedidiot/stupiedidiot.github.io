     <p>A campy title for an equally campy achievement! Yippee!! Go Me!!!<br><br>

	  Prior to compulsively making this site, I actually took some time to learn JavaScript. I read a handful of books on the topic and dicked around with small experiments. Despite this, the idea of making an entire blog was very daunting. I did the simple tasks of redoing my navigation bar in JavaScript, but after that I was at a complete loss. For this reason I cannot stress enough how thankful I am of <a href="https://twitter.com/even_kei">Marina Kittaka</a> for making <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a>. I learned quite a lot from replicating and modifying their code. Check it out if you want to quickly make a blog yourself<br><br>
	  
	  If you've followed me during my first two years on Instagram, you would know that I am quite the chatterbox. I was always rambling at length of whatever came to mind. Recently I decided to lessen my social media usage and uninstall all apps of the same nature. I can proudly say that my productivity has improved a lot since then. Whenever I’d install Instagram just to post a story, I find that I no longer found enjoyment in gabbing there. I found it annoying how I couldn’t edit simple spelling mistakes or remove unnecessary paragraphs. It reduced everything I wrote into word salad. If I wanted to change that I had to deleted it and rewrite everything from scratch!<br><br>
	  
	  This is why I’m so ecstatic of the idea of starting a blog! I have full customizability on not only with the text but where you’re reading that text from! That’s the coolest thing ever!!!! Having my own site also means I can isolate myself from distractions of social media, so yippee to that!!!<br><br>
	  
	  As proud as I am right now, I still have so much to do and I am excited to get right into. This is all for today. Goodbye and go eat some cheese :)</p>
