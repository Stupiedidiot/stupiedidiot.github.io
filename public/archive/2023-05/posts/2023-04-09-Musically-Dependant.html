	  Oh my god. I'm so unbelievably bored of all my music. I absolutely love blanking out and just jamming out to songs. It’s fun to imagine scenarios or leaving it in the background. Correction, it’s not ‘fun’. It’s a ‘need’. I literally cannot focus on certain tasks unless I’ve got something to numb out my thought process.

	  I usually find most of my music either through movies I’ve watched and whatever Spotify recommends to me. Then when I find something that fits my mood I go through that artist’s or band’s entire discography. Recently this has been a problem because (1) I haven’t been in too much of a good mindset to watch movies (2) I’ve been looping soundtracks of dumb children’s musicals and boring mellow oldie music. It has gotten my feed totally fucked and I don’t know what to listen to.

	  That’s when I remembered I have a “listen playlist”.

	  Currently going through it as I’m typing this. Out of the 36 songs there I’m going through Illuminate Hotties. Whenever I do this, I usually have no point of reference to who these people are and what their public status is. So sorry if I seem like an uncultured moron.

	  This all probably sounds silly to most of you but remember that most doesn’t mean all. I know for a fact some of you agree with the sentiment of the intense dependency to music. Moments like this remind me how pettily dumb humans are lmao. We are probably the only creature in this planet that gets this upset when we don’t get to hear a certain set of frequency arranged in a specific pattern.
