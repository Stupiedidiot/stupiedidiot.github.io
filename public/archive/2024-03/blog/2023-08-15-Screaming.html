<p>Hello. If you may excuse me for a moment... <marquee direction="right" scrollamount="15">AaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaAaaaaAaaaaaAAAAaaaaAAaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAaaAAAaaaAaaaaAaaaAaaaAAaaaAaAaAaaaaAaaAaAAaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaAaaaaAaaaaaAAAAaaaaAAaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAaaAAAaaaAaaaaAaaaAaaaAAaaaAaAaAaaaaAaaAaAAaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaAaaaaAaaaaaAAAAaaaaAAaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAaaAAAaaaAaaaaAaaaAaaaAAaaaAaAaAaaaaAaaAaA</marquee></p>
<p>As you can tell, school is starting next week. It has only now really dawned on me how much time I've wasted. I despise how quickly time flies by. If I find out who invented time, I'm going to live between the walls of their home and secretly move their stuff during the most inconvenient times possible.</p>
<p>Not a doubt in my mind that Covid has greatly stunned my learning. It feels like I've learned absolutely nothing in that time period. <i>"But Stupied, maybe you would of learned something if you weren't so busy playing Tetris between classes and didn't google translate all you activities".</i></p>
<p>Literally shut the fuck up!! We don't tolerate self-reflection and internalization here!! My struggles are everyone else's fault.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, it sucks feeling like I'm behind in class. For this summer I spent a bit of time relearning old lessons, lots of emphasis on 'a bit'. It's kinda terrifying to think that a couple years ago, I would already be considered a collage student.</p>
