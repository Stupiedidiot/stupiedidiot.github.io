<h2>What is Handshakes?</h2>
<p>Handshakes is a simple sokoban puzzle game with an interesting twist! In this game you control two characters with extendable arms. You can play the game with a friend, assuming if ever you have one of those. Based on how you’re here, you probably don’t have any.</p>
<p>Both characters can control with wasd and arrow keys respectively. In this game you have a very simple goal, do a handshake!!</p>

<p>If you are observant, you might of noticed that, in picrel, the friendly lil guys got numbers on their person. This is because each of them has limits to how far they can extend their arm. Each puzzle puts you against various challenges and it up to you to dictate their handshaking destiny!</p>
<p>Consider checking the game out. It’s for free after all!</p>
