<h2>Webmaster's Thoughts</h2>
<p>Handshakes can be finished in about an hour or two. There isn’t much content beyond 30 levels but honestly for a free game that is a lot. Is it worth getting into? Sure! I mean what else is there to risk aside from a couple fellows' arms.</p>
<p>It’s one of those games with simple mechanics but effectively difficult executions. The pacing is just right and gives you enough leverage to learn the quirks of the game. It’s a very promising premise and I would love to see more of it in the extended version.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will be going through the rest of the developer's works. </p>
