      <p>Created on 1937 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Parker">Gladys Parker</a>, Mospy is a charming little comic strip featuring a ditzy young woman. The character was inspired from interaction she had with a fellow cartoonist, who remakered that Glady's hair looked like a mop.</p>

      <p>Mopsy is one of the first few vintage comics I have read and I love the simple silly comedy. A really neat feature of the comic is having a paper doll spreads called "Mopsy Modes", which is the only reason why this page exist haha-</p>
