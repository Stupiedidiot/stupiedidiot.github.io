    <p>If it feels like I've been a lot more obnoxious as of late, it is because I have been. I don't have the best memory so it's best that I write this down. In about roughly 2 weeks from now, I will be graduating from senior high school. After which I'll have 2 more months before I start the first semester of collage. What I'm trying to get at is that I probably won't have this much free time in quite a while, so I'd like to take advantage of that as much as possible. This post will outline the different ways I can achieve this.</p>

<h2>Education and Programming</h2>
<p>I've decided to stop being a coward and peruse computer science. The past few years of working on this website has help me realize my love for programming. It's a lot of fun thinking up of projects, struggling to execute them, and discovering a weird quirk in computers that you would have otherwise never known about. I want to learn about different data structures and the most efficient ways of handling them. Of course this passion does not equate to knowledge. Which is why I searched up my university's syllabus so I can warm up to the topics beforehand. I was told that C was going to be the first programing language we'll work with, which is kind of terrifying. It is a huge leap from what I'm used to, but that's the point of studying in advance!!</p>

<h2>Visual Art and Literature</h2>
<p>I've written in the past about <a href="./../comic/muse-adriade/2024-02-05.html">my bad habit</a> of pacing around when I get excited of an idea. This intrusive activity is not only limited to writing but also to visual art. I've wasted so many hours imagining OC animations and interactions but never actually putting in the work for them to come into fruition. Two months is a lot of time and I have zero excuses to get at least one of them done! Will be trying my best to chip away with my long list of stuff I'd like to draw and finish the scripts of old comics.</p>

<h2>Social Presence and Mental Health</h2>
<p>Although it is not always obvious, I am an extremely anxious person. There isn't a moment in my life I'm not overthinking about the way others perceive me and the general state of the world. As self-defense, I shut myself out from everyone and convince myself I am happier that way. I am sick and tired of the fear of error and criticism dictating my opportunities. I want make friends and actually contribute to communities I care about.</p>

<p>Anyways thank you for taking the time to read this nothingburger of a blog post. Remember to take it easy and remind you're loved ones of how much you cherish them.</p>
