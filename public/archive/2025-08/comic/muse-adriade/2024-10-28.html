            <h1>50th Anniversary</h1>
            <p>Psyche had to admit they were kind of beautiful. The statues were carefully carved out to cast eerie shadows. The saint on the right faces up, basking in the display lights. Meanwhile Mary on left keeps her gaze below, politely putting her hands together as she ponders. Speaking of Marys, Psyche feels a gentle tug on her garment. It was Mary - Mary Day. Her knees were resting on the foam in front and Psyche figures she should probably do the same. By the time she attempts to the priest on the front commands everyone to rise back up again.</p>

            <p>This isn't what she would consider to be an ideal Saturday afternoon. Psyche would rather be back home on the family computer, never to see the sun ever again. She thinks back on how she even got here and remember the sensation of their fingers tangling together. Mary rested her head on Psyche's shoulder as whispered promised of lunch and jigsaw puzzles. She failed to point out they'd had to seat through a 2 hour long mass beforehand. It was getting tempting to just flip up the lid and play a few rounds of Pokemon Pinball. Watching a ball bouncing off fictional creatures would be more interesting than whatever the priest was rambling on. He went on about the significance of a wedding anniversary and claims that divorce is product of a couple's lack of faith. Unlike Psyche, Mary was listening intently while nodding to each and every statement.</p>

            <p>In an attempt to distract herself from the itchy cheap glittery dress she was in, she looks further upward. The ceiling, much like the floor, had a colorful repeating pattern. It looked like it was glued in, occasionally distorted by the inconsistent leveling of the concrete. If you looked closely, you could spot where the paper starts and ends between the edges of irregular shaped corners. Overall, the ceiling matched nicely with the tinted glass murals, which were positioned above a set of clear windows where you can see the dark green trees against a bright blue background. A far cry from the meticulous planned interior, the clouds wonder freely on the sky. It makes her wonder why we contribute so much of our work to such an unorganized and unpredictable person.</p>
