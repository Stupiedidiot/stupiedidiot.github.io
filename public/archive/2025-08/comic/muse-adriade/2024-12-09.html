            <h1>Electrodynamics</h1>
            <p>Cold and tinted blue, a weather like this is best suited with a warm embrace from someone you love. Unfortunately, I don't have anyone so words will have to suffice. The friction between my pen and yellow pad is the only thing keeping me warm. There were collage students holding a talent show nearby the covered court but it It was hard to make out the contestant's singing though the droplets crashing into its' fallen comrades. The snake plants, smothered by the excess water, began to shamefully bend over.</p>

            <p>I've been working on this assignment since Monday and it feels like I've made no progress. Usually at this point I would consult Psyche for answers but she's currently distracted by something. More accurately, Psyche was distracted by someone. Mary had her head rested on the table with her phone held up horizontally to align with her view. Psyche was snuggled up closely with her arms curled around Mary's waist. The red head leans in closely to her ear and whisper something. I realized that despite knowing Psyche since Elementary, Mary is probably more familiar with her voice than I am. When did she get this talkative?</p>

            <p>Between her and Evan, she was always the responsible one but she had a bad habit of never updating us on her progress. Assuming that she is even making any. She liked to wait till the last minuet to 'speedrun' everything and the output is usually the absolute bare minimum. Like a detached leaf in a canal on a rainy day, she doesn't exert anymore effort she thinks is required and lets the streams whisk her way. She applies this principal to every aspect of her life. From her school work to her friendships. Always standing by, never uttering a single objection to the waves' whims I sort of forgot the two were beside me and jumped at their sudden burst of laughter. Well, I suppose there is a few exceptions to her principal. I pulled out my phone and wrote down a note to remind myself to disarrange Psyche's video game cartridges the next time I visit.</p>
